Okay, so this is a gameflow blueprint for my Blackjack Sinatra webapp

/home
  Here it could either be a login form of sorts, or maybe some sort of a welcome
  message + a link to a login form
  (could redirect to /login or /name) GET

/login
  Here one would need to give his/her name into the designed form
    - the name would be saved to a cookie (param, variable) POST
    - after clicking some sort of login button, it'd need to redirect
      to a /betting phase GET

/betting
  Here the player would specify the bet amount
    - the amount needs to be stored somewhere too POST
    - (probably we'd need a bankroll variable of sorts as well)
    - after specifying the bet, clicking a bet button would
      further re-direct to the /game phase itself GET

/game
  Here the hand takes place
    - logic would need to be implemented here somehow
      - logic probably could be just copied from procedural blackjack
      - GUI
        - cards/hands
        - hit and stay buttons
    - we'd probably also need some alerts for result of a given hand
    - after the hand finishes, we'd need to store new bankroll POST
    - if one decides to continue playing, we'd redirect him back to
      the betting phase

NEXT to do:
  - make some mockups
   - do it better graphically then in the example! go one step further and show yourself!
    (you know some front-end, be the guy who goes the extra mile!)
